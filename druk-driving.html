I couldn't believe I didn't think of this while posting Paro's very snowy weather forecast on my Instagram the night before.

When the sun sets before the clock strikes 6. And I was hoping to celebrate Bhutan's National Day (December 17) <strong>in</strong> Bhutan, with the Bhutanese people. C- for planning and estimation right there. However, what sets your true blind spots apart is the fact that you don't know that you can't see them until they smack you in the face.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="1"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5527.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5527-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="New hutanese friend travelling in India as I was going to Bhutan" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>New bhutanese friend travelling in India as I was going to Bhutan</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Every person I consulted for the trip, I asked "is the Bhutanese border open on National day?" - and they all told me it was.

For those who can't see where this is going - when I reached Jaigaon at 8 pm and scrambled to see if I can just cross over immediately, I was met with equal parts laughter and surprise from the Indian and Bhutanese border patrol agents.

Raring to go, I planned to be the first in line at the immigration desk the next morning. Which I did - at 8 am - but it was raining so I let braver souls take my spot while I sought shade and tried to bring myself to terms with my new position in the queue - about 10<sup>th</sup>. Unbeknownst to me, this would become a real problem when I misunderstand the permit process and head straight to the final verification clerk on the desk. Miffed, he asked me to go the gentleman seated 3 feet to his right, to whom I now seemed to be coming from 'the wrong side' and therefore cutting in line. For reasons I can't understand, he threw me to the back of the line and threatened to have anyone 'taking my side' follow me - this wasn't the happy gentry I was promised. I finally got my permit at noon. The permit for the bike took another 2 hours, and I finally departed Phuentsholing for Paro at 2:30 pm. The Bhutanese police stop every vehicle just before the highway and say - "don't honk, this is not India".</p><p>It's amazing what the lush Himalayan countryside does to your temper. I went from 'pissed' to 'ecstatic' in about 5 minutes. In another 25, I went from 'ecstatic' to 'concerned' when the light rain turned to a rainstorm. With the dropping temperatures and my progressively numbing extremities (multiplied by the fact that my riding gloves weren't waterproof), I decided at 4:30 pm that I will stop and seek help at the next sign of humanity. If there was one thing Ladakh taught me, it was to not challenge nature. So I still do it, but in moderation. In another 30 minutes I saw some people sitting by a fire in a cabin over a valley. I parked the bike, stumbled into the cabin, and basically crumbled by the fire. It is hard to put in words the warmth that I received from both the fire and the people. We were a few kilometres from Gedu, and as it turns out, it was the last town before the new 'mega-highway' takes you directly to Paro in another 3 hours with no notable towns or villages along the way. I met a group of bikers returning to India from Paro - under significant duress due to this rain and the snowstorm that they started with - who congratulated me for making it this far and begged me to not go any further that day. The local people, on the other hand, egged me on. "We go there all the time." "In this weather?" "Yes." "After sunset?" "Yes." "On a 2-wheeler?" "No, but you will be fine." The weather gods also tempted me with some literal rays of sunshine which lasted for about 10 minutes, but by the time I finished eating, the storm had surrounded us again. In one of my rarer decisions, I said no to this adventure and planned to sleep in - in what was apparently the last available room in the town's local guest house. With nothing to do, I threw my stuff in the room and headed back to the cabin to spend time with these new friends. There, I came across another Indian couple (from Bangalore, no less) who were heading to Paro. I talked to them the sense that my experiences had hammered into me, and since there was no space left in the town to sleep anymore, I invited Lalith and his wife to sleep in my room.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5541.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5541-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Deceptive rays of hope in the storm" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>Deceptive rays of hope in the storm</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5543.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5543-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Honest rays of hope in the morning" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>Honest rays of hope in the morning</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5544.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5544-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="The holy shelter" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>The holy shelter</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The next morning was as different from the last was as it could have been - at 7 am, it was all still very cold, but not a cloud in sight. We started in pursuit of a breakfast joint, and we found one run by the Indian army. The jawans told us that at least 3 people died trying to drive through the storm last night - and I had no trouble believing him given the number of skid marks and abandoned-after-accident trucks and cars I saw on the road that day.

During my tour, two kids gingerly approached me, and asked me where I'm from. A couple of exchanges later, they declared that they had accepted me in their best friend group. And this was before I even told them that I was there in a bike - which made them absolutely lose it, run out to the parking area, and climb on the Himalayan. "Sell this to me. How much?" "2 lakh rupees." (looking at his friend) "I don't think mother will give me so much money". It was getting dark, and the adult in me did want to hand my new friends over to other adults, so we set about finding their family. This was an unexpectedly emotional goodbye.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5607-1.jpeg" data-size="2710x3614"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5607-1-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Pena Lakhang" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>Pena Lakhang</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5612.jpeg" data-size="1932x2576"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5612-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="New friends and casual bike enthusiasts" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>New friends and casual bike enthusiasts</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The next day, I had to climb that-monastery-by-the-side-of-<wbr>a-mountain / the unofficial symbol of Bhutan / the Tiger's Nest Monastery. I was staying almost in the mountain's shadow, so I was about 3 kms from the parking point. In my infinite wisdom, I took off without my protective gear. A rash (Indian) car overtook me, and I shrugged it off - I just wanted to let the second car pass me by too. You never want to be between two cars as a biker in the mountains. That's when a sudden slope appeared, the car in front of me lost balance, and so did I. Given the laws of physics, though, cars are difficult to tumble after low-speed mistakes but bikes have it especially easy. So I did, and waited on my back in the middle of the road for the second car to run me over at 15 km/h. Thankfully, this guy was a better driver than the rest of us, and he stopped his vehicle and stepped out to help me. Bless his soul. A hiking stick fashioned out of a tree branch helped me navigate the mountain as if nothing happened, and I ended up climbing the Tiger's Nest. The climb up was actually easier for my hurt knee than the descent, but meeting people like Ibrahim (and his son), who entertained me with stories of their other adventures helped me recharge every few hundred metres. Finally, I got back to Ama's loaded my things on the bike, and prepared for my departure to Thimphu. </p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5642.jpeg" data-size="1932x2576"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5642-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="My trusty walking stick" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>My trusty walking stick</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5700.jpeg" data-size="3024x4032"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5700-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Jack the backpack" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>Jack the backpack</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5720.jpeg" data-size="2225x2967"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5720-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Watching the watch" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>Watching the watch</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>A chase by a few rather muscular street dogs aside, the late-evening ride into <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25815280" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25815280&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641051650886000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XjCJl_b2rcdIzZJGytmZh" rel="noopener">Little Village</a> was quiet. Exhausted after a long day, I had some food and proceeded to collapse directly at the sight of a bed. I decided to stay collapsed for the next day, effectively abandoning the idea of exploring Thimphu. A 'vacation from a vacation', so to speak. The cottage had a far-away view of the famous Buddha statue, and I guess that was good enough for me. I chatted with the family all day, who told me that they had bears and boars roaming in the exact spot where I stood before they put the fencing up a few months ago, because 'technically' this was all still a jungle. Ah, the comfort of knowing that I will probably not be mauled to death inside the farm (but could have been while driving up to it yesterday, or could be while leaving it tomorrow).</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5731-2.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5731-2-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Vacation with a view" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>Vacation with a view</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5733-2.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5733-2-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Vacation with more view" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>Vacation with more view</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5738-2.jpeg" data-size="4032x3024"><img loading="lazy" src="https://abhishekchoudhary.com/blog/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_5738-2-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Picturesque entrance to the house" width="768" height="576"></a><figcaption>Picturesque entrance to the house</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Fascinating talks went on for the entire day, interspersed with reading sessions in truly pin-drop silence, before I turned in again and prepared to leave this wonderful land.
